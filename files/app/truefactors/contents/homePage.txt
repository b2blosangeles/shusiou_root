<h5>About Plato Plan</h5>
<p>
  <b>Abstract</b> : PlatoPlan Platform is to inspire every dream maker on the earth. She will provide easy access to
  file and publish innovative concept, ideas, products, works. More importantly, PlatoPlan will help those
  inventors to go through all the necessary processes to turn their original concept or ideas into a practical
  and tangible status. The more innovations published on PlatoPlan, more sparkles will be ignited. And it
  will attract individuals’ inventors, investors, enterprises and normal human beings, to search the origins
  of the innovations on PlatoPlan. Then its commercial value and social impact will be valueless.	
</p>
<p>
  <b>Chapter 1 Inventor</b> : PlatoPlan Platform will provide an interface for anyone to register 
  as member of PlatoPlan. This will include the NDA and legal immunity for PlatoPlan to help file any 
  concepts, works, ideas, audios, via video, documentation, photograph or other possible means. 
  PlatoPlan will help the inventors to edit their IP files and publish their edited IP files selected 
  at their own will. Meanwhile, PlatoPlan will provide interfaces to help the inventor to realize their 
  IP concepts or finished works into a tangible or industrial or commercial or legal form. PlatoPlan 
  will be honestly record the time while the file is revealed to the public and thus to protect the 
  IP rights of the investors..	
</p>
<p><u>Interfaces for inventors</u></p>	

<p>
  <p><i>Login/Register</i></p>
  Legal team will be involved from the initial stage to make sure PlatoPlan can collect the information of
  the inventors in an appropriate and legal way. This will include the NDA， agreement between inventors
  and PlatoPlan, so on and so forth.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Record/Upload</i></p>
  PlatoPlan will provide an app or web function to help the inventor to record their works, concepts, etc.
  via video or any latest technologies. Besides the inventor can upload their existing files in any possible
  media forms which PlatoPlan can recognize and accept into the system.
</p>


<p>
  <p><i>Edit/File</i></p>
  The Inventor will be enabled to edit their own IP files before or after loading. PlatoPlan will adopt the
  latest and advanced technology to make an easy access for inventor to edit and upload their IP files. The
  Inventor will then create their person file archives and they can save, edit, publish, apply for other
  requests later.
</p>


<p>
  <p><i>Publish/Conceal</i></p>
  The inventors can choose if they want to publish or conceal or withdraw their works to the public first
  before they think it is mature enough and well protected. Or they can just publish an edited or selected
  briefing of their IP work to the public to make the first record of their evidence of ORIGINATION. This
  will be mostly important for the inventor to prove they are the very first one to think and find the
  solution or create the work for such area.
</p>
<p>
  And the major function of PlatoPlan is to help the Inventor to acquire the IP record of Original publisher
  and meanwhile to conceal the major invention in a confidential status before the necessary legal actions
  taken, like application of copyright or patent, etc.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Copyright/Patent</i></p>
  The inventors can choose to apply for a copyright review before they publish their IP work. (This <b>will be
  starting point for PlatoPlan to get the income from.</b>) Or the inventors might have their own copyright
  applied, they can just publish their work. The handling of the such requests of copyright could be a
  tremendous work as any simple idea will need work to research and thus AI or latest technologies will
  be needed to take over such workload.
</p>

<p>
  Once the inventors have finalized their initial concepts and make their prototype work ready for a stage
  of applying for a patent. They may consult PlatoPlan or use their own resources to acquire their patent
  application processes. They can choose to reveal the whole invention to the public once they acquired
  their patent or keep it concealed. Obviously, it depends on the Inventors if they want to be
  acknowledged by the public or keep their own confidential status.
</p>


<p>
  <p><i>Sponsor/Investment</i></p>
  The inventors might need sponsorship for the application fee of copyright or patent. Balabala can help
  them link up with related organizations or individuals, who is willing to support the innovation. Balabala
  will set up the function and promote globally to make the proper protection.
</p>

<p>
  The inventors can seek the investment as well to help them finalize the application of patent or
  engineering, or industrialization, or commercialization, etc. Investor might be investing as charity
  sponsorship or acquire the returns of the production or buy the copyright or patent directly. (<b>PlatoPlan’s
  bonus point</b>) Balabala can found her own innovation funding to be involved in such process as well.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Interaction/Protection</i></p>
  PlatoPlan provides the platform for the interaction between inventors, engineers, investors,
  manufactures, sellers, bankers, etc. There should be various approaches to keep the IP works or ideas
  sparkling. Thus, more people will benefit from the published IP work and keep the progressing of the
  human beings while not backwards by hiding the innovations. (<b>PlatoPlan should keep the clean and
  rightness of the platform to make sure those dangerous, negative, or hazardous concepts or ideas
  shown to the public.</b>) There should be an automatic filtering system to prevent such publication is
  revealed to the public. While Balabala should be <b>免责</b> from such actions.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Award/Challenge</i></p>
  PlatoPlan will organize related experts to audit those published works periodically in various areas. Those
  awarded IP works will be prized or recommended or sponsored or invested by related demanding
  parties.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, anyone or enterprises will propose a call for inventors to help them to resolve certain
  challenges in their work. This activity can stimulate some direct innovation and realize into daily work
  and life immediately.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Educate/Train</i></p>
  An Innovation Academic program will be carried on helping individuals or enterprise to learn the process
  for innovation like in MEDICAL area, arts, engineering, daily work solutions, etc. This has been highly
  demanded for high school students, college students, individual innovators. Those related links will be
  opened to share the resources like TED innovation, YOUTUBE, etc.
</p>

<p>
  There is a sentence “The tools make the human being progressed.” The true situation is the Innovation
  make us developed into higher and higher level to understand the universe and ourselves. Thus, training
  people to become an inventor, to keep our curiosity is the essence and fundamental function of
  PlatoPlan. The study of the progress of human history will see all our progress and development will
  originate from building up FIRE, make a weapon in our daily life till the spaceship to MARS for exploring
  the space. The later one obviously requires more training of those engineers or related scientists for
  such sophisticated work.
</p>


<p>
  <p><i>Design/Produce</i></p>
  The inventor will invite the related and capable designer and manufacturer to help realize the IP works.
  This is extremely important to bring these ideas into real life. Therefore, the qualified (paid members)
  will have the privilege to be matched for such requests. Besides, the platform will organize a
  professional project transfer leader to handle such request. This will make things even easier to move
  forward.
</p>

<p>
  <p><i>Market/Sell</i></p>
  PlatoPlan should provide a function to help those IP and finalized IP works to be brought into the market.
  And it can be sold to those individual or enterprise who seeks for innovative IPs.
</p>

<p>
  This will become the most income of Balabala as the paid member will be able to receive filtered IP
  information on a periodical basis. Existing IPs from the past can be traded on PlatoPlan.
</p>

<p>
  On the contrary, any request for invention or problem solutions can be published too to seek for
  immediately reactions universally.
</p>

<p>
  When the platform is growing up enough, the verified individuals or manufactures or anyone who will
  be able to sell their IP works or products directly to other individual consumers. Obviously, the future
  development of the flexible and customized production will make it easier to realize. Especially for
  individual customized production to realize characterized items.
