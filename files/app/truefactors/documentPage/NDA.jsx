			<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</h2>
			<p>
			This Confidentiality Agreement is made at sight by the registered member (“Register”)and
			Plato Plan Inc. , a company organized under the laws of California, USA (“Plato Plan”).		
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Plato Plan Inc and Company may be referred to in this Agreement as a “party” or the “parties.”
			A party that discloses Confidential Information to the other party may be referred to as the
			“disclosing party,” and the party that receives Confidential Information from the other party may
			be referred to as the “receiving party.”		
			</p>
			
			<p>
			In connection with the potential or actual purchase and sale of products and/or services from one
			party to the other, the parties may disclose Confidential Information (as defined below) to each
			other and their employees (“Employees”).		
			</p>

			<p>
			Accordingly, in consideration of the disclosure of Confidential Information to each other, the
			parties agree as follows:		
			</p>
			
			<p>
			1. “Confidential Information” means all information concerning the business, affairs,
			products, research and technologies of the parties that is not publicly available at the time it is
			disclosed to or learned by the receiving party or its Employees. Confidential Information also
			includes any information that a party obtains or has obtained from another third party and which
			the party is obligated to treat as proprietary or confidential.		
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Confidential Information includes, without limitation, all of the following:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>product specifications; data; know-how; formulas; compositions; processes; designs;
				sketches; photographs; samples; prototypes; inventions; concepts; ideas; past, current and
				planned research and development; past, current and planned manufacturing or
				distribution methods and processes;
				</li>
				<li>the identity of or other information about actual or potential customers, customer contacts
				and customer sales strategies;
				</li>
				<li>market studies, penetration data and other market information; sales and marketing plans,
				programs and strategies;
				</li>
				<li>sales, costs, and other financial data;
				</li>
				<li>the identity of or other information about actual or potential product suppliers and
				sources of supply for products, raw materials, and components; supplier contact
				information; plant descriptions and descriptions of production equipment;
				</li>
				<li>price lists; business plans; financial reports and statements;
				</li>				
				<li>computer software and programs (including object code and source code); databases;
				</li>
				<li>internal reports, memoranda, notes, analyses, compilations and studies; and other data,
				information, materials or intangibles that relate to Sunway’s and/or its customers’
				business and/or products.
				</li>	
			</ul>
			<p>Confidential Information also includes any material or information that contains or is based on
			any other Confidential Information, whether prepared by either party or their Employees, or any
			other person.</p>
			
			<p>
			2. Information and materials will be conclusively deemed to be Confidential Information if
			marked as confidential or proprietary at the time disclosed. Any information disclosed orally
			will be conclusively deemed Confidential Information if the disclosing party notifies the
			receiving party that it is confidential or proprietary at any time following disclosure. A party’s
			failure, however, to mark information or materials as confidential or proprietary or to notify the
			other party that oral information is confidential or proprietary will not affect the information’s or
			material’s confidential or proprietary nature.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			3. The parties agree to (a) keep each other’s Confidential Information strictly confidential
			and disclose it only to those Employees (i) who need to know such Confidential Information in
			order for the party to explore and facilitate a business relationship with the other party and (ii)
			who are subject to the same or comparable obligations of confidentiality, (b) use the Confidential
			Information solely for the purpose of, and only to the extent required for, exploring and
			facilitating a business relationship with the other party and (c) obtain the other party’s written
			consent before disclosing any information that could, under any circumstances, constitute
			Confidential Information.			
			</p>	

			<p>
			4. The parties agree that, with respect to the purchase or sale of any products purchased or
			sold by the disclosing party on or after the date of this agreement, the receiving party may not
			and shall not solicit any contract, agreement, arrangement, or understanding, directly or
			indirectly, with any customer of or supplier to the disclosing party whose identity is disclosed to
			receiving party by disclosing party.			
			</p>

			<p>
			5. The obligations and limitations set forth herein regarding Confidential Information shall
			not apply to information that is:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>at any time in the public domain other than by a breach of this Agreement by the
				party who received such Confidential Information;
				</li>
				<li>at any time received from a third party that has the right to furnish it to the party
				without restrictions on disclosure or use;
				</li>
				<li>known to the party without any restriction on disclosure or use prior to its receipt
				from the other party or independently developed by the party; or
				</li>	
				<li>authorized in writing by the disclosing party to be disclosed by the other party.
				</li>	
			</ul>
			
			<p>
			6. Confidential Information supplied shall not be reproduced in any form by the receiving
			party or its Employees except as required to accomplish the purpose of this Agreement.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			7. Upon the request of the disclosing party, the receiving party agrees to return all
			documents and materials containing any Confidential Information, as well as all copies thereof.		
			</p>
			
			<p>
			8. The parties will cause all of their Employees to comply with the terms of this Agreement.
			Each party will be liable and responsible for any violation of the terms of this Agreement by any
			of its Employees. A party will immediately inform the other party of any breach of this
			Agreement by any of its Employees, and the party will take all steps needed to halt any current
			violation and prevent future violations of this Agreement.			
			</p>

			<p>
			9. Neither party shall have any commitment or obligation to enter into any further
			agreement with the other party or to refrain from dealing with any third party in any manner
			whatsoever, except as expressly agreed by the parties in writing.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			10. This Agreement is limited to terms and conditions governing the disclosure and use of
			Confidential Information, and no supply or other commercial relationship or obligation between
			the parties is created by this Agreement.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			11. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties concerning the subject matter
			hereof. No modification or waiver of the terms of this Agreement will be binding unless in
			writing and signed by Sunway and Company.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			12. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota applicable to
			contracts executed in and to be performed in the State of Minnesota. The parties hereby submit
			to the jurisdiction of any state or federal courts located in the State of Minnesota. The parties
			agree that monetary damages are an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement and that
			injunctive relief is an appropriate additional remedy.
